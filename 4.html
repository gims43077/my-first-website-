            <p style="margin-top:20px">The<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_(programming_system)" target = "_blank" title ="what is html">Web</a></strong> is a computer programming system created by Donald E.
            Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by <u>embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse</u> (as is common practice in most programming languages),
            in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:20px">Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX"><strong>TeX</strong></a>.<br>
                CWEB is a version of Web for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by Web (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.<br>
                The most significant programs written in Web are TeX and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont"><strong>Metafont</strong></a>. Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert Web source to C.
